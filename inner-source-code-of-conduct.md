# Platform - Inner Source Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants who wish to contribute to this Platform InnerSource repository.

## Making a Positive Contribution to this Project ##

We actively encourage you to contribute to the project to:

* Help make each others lives easier.
* Leave things better than when they were found.
* Improve it - Use it, Extend it, Create it, Clean it.
* Help us to lower the barrier for experiments based on this project.
* Ensure our Documentation is great; always add more if you find gaps or errors.

**We favour contributions via Pull Requests, not Feature Requests or Issues. Please raise this directly against the repository.**


In doing so we ask that you respectfully:

* Reduce scope, not standards.
* Discuss with the repository owners any changes in advance of making them (to avoid roadmap conflicts)
* Don't reinvent the wheel and duplicate what is available elsewhere.
* Follow our Coding Standards, Naming Conventions and Test approach.
* Demo to the team before you request a merge.
* Agree to a 30 day warranty for your changes from the day it is merged.
* Be considerate of your changes - Your changes will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the changes made by others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.


And in return we commit to:

* Review all contributions (pull requests) within **7** days.
* Be friendly and patient with you and your requests.
* Be welcoming of changes made by others and support you with your contributions.
* Embrace mistakes and errors - with support and guidance on how to address them.
* Offer guidance via our slack channel #channel-name
